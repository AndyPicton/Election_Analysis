## Overview of Election Audit
I recently helped Seth and Tom submit election audit results to the election commission but they are asking for more information. They asked for the following additional data:
 - Voter turnout for each county
 - Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
 - County with the highest turnout
I was able to collect and analyze the data using the following resources.
